# Traverso(webautomation)

This project is a **user-defined web automation and data extraction platform** designed to reliably automate browser-based workflows without requiring users to write code. The system enables users to record real interactions on websites—such as clicks, form inputs, navigation, and data selection—using a custom browser extension. These interactions are converted into a structured, versioned workflow that represents deterministic browser actions.
